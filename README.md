This project is a command-line implementation of the popular board game, ["Battleship"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

To play the game, navigate into the src folder and run the file "Game.py" from a command-line window.

The game "board" is a 10 x 10 grid on which ships of varying sizes are randomly placed. Each player gets 1 large ship (size 4), 2 medium ships (size 3), 3 small ships (size 2), and 4 extra small ships (size 1), for a total of 10 ships each.

This implementation is a single player game only. The player competes against a bot. The game is over when all of a player's ships are destroyed.
